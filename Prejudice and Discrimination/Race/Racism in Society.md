- In some of the early chapters of Harper Lee's 1960 novel, _To Kill A Mockingbird_, we are introduced to the character of Ms Caroline and young schoolteacher who had come from another town. The chapters expand on some of the classroom sessions, showing some of the ways Ms Caroline was unaware of many of the cultural norms the rest had beome very much accustomed to.
