| Word               | Definition                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Role of Humans** | Tasks that require some form of intelligence and decision making / creative thinking rather than menial labour. |

## Points

- **AI today requires human intervention to be maintained**
  - All advanced critical thinking of AI requires collaborating with an AI
  - GitHub Copilot: requires humans to suggest what they wish to code, Copilot is simply a tool (Literally called **copilot**)
- **AI requires advanced computations that may not be easily executable in normal settings?**
  - GPT-3 exists, but you have to access it from an API, and you can only use a limited set of API requests?
- **AI does not have a just set of ethics how do you fudging justify this**
