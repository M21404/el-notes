# Ethics in Science



Different peer-review processes in research:

|        Process        |                         Single Blind                         |                         Double Blind                         |

|          How          | Authors are unaware of who the Reviewers are, but the Reviewers know who the Authors are |  Authors and Reviewers are both unaware of who the other is  |
| Why is **DB** Better? | The name of the authors is a considerable factor in the peer review process. | Anonymity ensures that quality of paper is assessed rather than the name of the authors |
|       Examples        | Peter Higgs, whose seminal paper postulating the existence of the Higgs Boson, was rejected by the Physics Letters Journal, one infamous for employing single blind protocol in peer review processes, although later it was proven to be true and Higgs even won a Nobel Prize for his work back in 2013. | NYU Professor Yann LeCun, who is internationally regarded as one of the pioneers of modern AI development, recently posted on many Social Media sites with the proud admission that one of his most recent papers was rejected by the NeurIPS journal, one graded on double blind protocol. |
