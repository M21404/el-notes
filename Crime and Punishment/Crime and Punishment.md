# Crime and Punishment







## Interesting Hooks

This is probably not counted as fully legitimate evidence, but rather something to keep the reader on the tenterhooks.

- In the 1994 prison drama, _The Shawshank Redemption_, the life story of an innocent man thrust into prison is shown, spanning nearly 20 years. As we progress through the story, we see him slowly but surely see the cruel injustices faced in prison, with his management of the corrupt warden's ledger. While an offense on its own, its rather ironic for a man as situationally perpetuated to be innocent as the warden to take over the role of a criminal. Unfortunately that is the case.
